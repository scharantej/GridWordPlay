Alright, let's work on designing a Flask application that fulfills the requirements of creating a word search game in a 4x4 grid.

### **HTML Files**

- **index.html**: This will be the main page where the user can interact with the word search game.
  - It should contain:
    - A section to display the 4x4 grid, initially empty.
    - A form to allow the user to input words they want to hide in the grid.
    - A submit button to start the game.
  - The page will use JavaScript to create the grid and populate it with the words provided by the user.


- **results.html**: This page will display the completed word search grid and the list of words the user successfully found.
  - It should contain:
    - A section displaying the 4x4 grid, now containing the hidden words and the remaining empty spaces.
    - A list of the words that the user successfully located in the grid.
  - This page will be loaded after the user has submitted their answers.


### **Routes**

- **home()**: This route will handle the main page (index.html).

- **generate_grid()**: This route will take the user-inputted words and randomly place them in the 4x4 grid. It will then generate an HTML response containing the grid and return it.

- **check_answers()**: This route will handle the submission of the user's answers. It will check if the words the user found match the words hidden in the grid. It will then generate an HTML response containing the results and return it.
